# Pulser

Pulser is a server and app that gives you the status of anything you wish directly to your phone.

For example, you could see the progress of a large download on your home server through the app, or if you have an internet connected doorbell (for some reason) you could see how many times it was pressed since you had left the house.

This is being made for my "Mobile and Web Technology" computer science module at university.

# Current State

I have considered this application to be finished. While it could be vastly improved, it's not worth the effort for the marks in return I'll get. Just being honest.

Also, the iOS app will not run because I accidentally removed the necessary (supposedly "unnecessary", according to [this](https://github.com/TomboFry/pulser/tree/9e7843385d64ebe06d021ecdd4d444c4e49cb767) commit) .pbxproj file, and I currently have no intention of readding it.
